# hello-world

Hi there! This is just a testing ground for me to try out coding.
There might be some... bad code here, mostly because I'm testing out some real life programs from ideas, mostly from friends because I don't even know where to start writing some real code.

Expect something from me though. I will pull through.

Yours truly,
-Milford.
